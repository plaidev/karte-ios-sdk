# How to Contribute

We currently do **NOT** accept any feature request PRs.
In some rare cases, we may accept bug fixes but there is absolutely no commitment or expectation for that and you should not rely on that in any way.
If you want to request a feature or report a bug, please open a new issue.

## Submitting changes

Please consider following guidelines before creating a PR:

- Confirm the intention and design of your change by reaching out to your account manager.
- Run swiftlint before creating PR and fix warning.
- Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
- Add unit tests for the code that you have touched.
- Start creating your pull request from `master` branch
- Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)).
